### Hey there!  
I'm a young electronic hobbyist on a journey to become a programmer and/or an electronic engineer. 

I am interested in programming, tech, electronics, retro stuff and computers. I'm mostly self-learning from sources like the internet. I'm also a Linux enthusiast and I primarily use Debian, even on my main desktop.

I mainly code in languages like **C++, C, Javascript, Python, Assembly (x86/6502), and PHP/HTML**. Additionally, I've also got some experience with C# and Lua. I can learn new languages pretty fast if I need or want to.
